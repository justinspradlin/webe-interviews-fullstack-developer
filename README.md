# WEBE LIVE CODING SESSION [FULLSTACK]

Welcome, This is a live coding session aimed to access you.

You have `50 minutes` to attempt `4 challenges`.

For each challenge, there is an accompanying `Jest Test Suite` to help test the correctness of your solutions.

At any point, you can run the `test suite` for any challenge you are working on by running `jest {name_of_challenge}` in
your terminal. For example; say you are working on the challenge in the `q1 folder`, you can at anytime, run the test
suite for `q1` by running:

```bash
jest q1
```

#### NOTES

* Try to answer as many questions as you can.
* Take your time to carefully read the instructions for each challenge.

#### SUBMISSION

When you are done or the timer runs out, You are required to:

1. Open your terminal and run `jest` to test all the challenges.
2. take a screenshot of the output and send using the `Zoom in-call chat` feature.

Ensure the last portion of the output (where the total result is shown) is visible in the screenshot.

An example screenshot is as shown below:

#### READY?

Ready to begin? Open any `Clock App` on your PC or Mac and set a timer for `50 Minutes`.

You can also use [This Google Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer+50+minutes&oq=timer#cobssid=s) to set a 50
minutes
timer.

### Good luck ðŸ¥³.
